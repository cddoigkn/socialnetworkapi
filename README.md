# Social Network API

## Introduction

Hi there, I'm Casey and this is a semi-basic structure for a social networking app! The goal is to use a combination of routes, controllers, and models within node and mongoose in order to create a website capable of having users create accounts, both add and delete friends from their friend list, make posts, and react to everyone else's posts and comments!

## Installation

To install this, simply download the file, go into the terminal, and type 'npm install', then use the command 'npm run start' or 'node server.js' to begin the network!
